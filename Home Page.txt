Anyone is welcome to edit the wiki. All we ask for, is that you make accurate, helpful and relevant contributions, so that others who may read the wiki are not misguided and information is provided clearly. This means that any form of trolling and related will not be tolerated. We also encourage to use proper English and explain content to your best ability while keeping it at an appropriate length.

To edit an existing page, click the Edit button found in the top right corner of said page. To create a new page, click Create New Page under the sub nav of the Wiki tab. You may first want to check the Page List to ensure that the same or similar page has not already been created before. In addition, it is highly recommended to preview any changes before saving, to ensure that you have proof-read and corrected any mistakes or formatting errors.

If you notice something that definitely seems out of place, such as abuse of content, please contact a member of staff or brajo, whom will be able to properly deal with the problem.​
